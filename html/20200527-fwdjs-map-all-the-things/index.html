            a lot of data governments (and people) care about is geospatial: you can and should
            put it on a map.  that's long been the case, as you can see from this 1915 map
            exploring how people get around Toronto.
          </p>
          <p>
            so geospatial data's nothing new.  what's new is the size of that data.
            on the MOVE project, for instance, we handle 1.5M collisions and 120M
            traffic volume readings.

          </p>
          <p>
            to handle larger datasets on maps, we need performant tools for
            rendering a lot of data at once.
            to understand these datasets, we need to carefully present it.
            and to handle especially large or complex datasets, we need to process it ahead
            of time to make these first two things possible.

          to render data in MOVE, we use a library called Mapbox GL.
          it's not the only mapping library out there: Leaflet and OpenLayers.
          that said, it has a number of very useful features, as we'll see
          throughout this presentation.

          as with most complex graphics, maps are often built out of layers.  the bottom-most
          layer is your basemap, with everything from continents to streets, parks, and buildings.
          </p>
          <p>
            in web mapping, you need a container div to store your map in.  Mapbox GL is no different.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've disabled a bunch of Mapbox GL's 3D navigation features for this talk - so I won't
            be showing those off, but with the right data they're really awesome.  finally we load all
            of these options into a map object.

          for this talk, I'll be focusing on data from Toronto.  that means we need to put
          Toronto in its rightful place at the center of the universe.  just as with other
          mapping libraries, you can set minimum and maximum zoom levels as well as a bounding
          box for panning.  unlikely that you need all zoom levels.

            I'm using the last 3 years, or about 150k collisions.  I pull those out of the
            database: in Mapbox GL, each feature needs an ID and a geometry; you can also
            add more properties.  we can then take those features and convert them to
            GeoJSON features using JSON functions in PostgreSQL.  then we can aggregate
            them all into a GeoJSON feature collection and dump that out.

            now the fun part.  we start with source: GeoJSON type, using our newly loaded
            collisions data.  we then create layer: give it an ID, tie it to the collisions
            source, and use type circle - we're going to draw circles for each data point.
          </p>
          <p>
            in Mapbox GL, you can style your layers.  here we're telling it how to draw
            these circles: what color, what outline, how big.

          <p>
            takes a while to load: as we'll discuss in a bit, Mapbox GL is doing a lot of work up
            front to make sure we can navigate this smoothly once it loads.
          </p>
          <p></p>
            the result is pretty jarring, and in more ways than one.  first: that's 150k collisions
            over 3 years.  50k per year, 150 per day, 6 per hour.  even though most are minor, the
            human impact of this is staggering.
          </p>

          <p>
            this map doesn't do the dataset justice.  you can see there's a lot of collisions,
            but it's impossible to get much more than that.
          </p>

          <p>
            that said, once it loads, we can navigate pretty smoothly.  if you've ever tried loading
            150k div markers on a mapping library, it's not this smooth.

          <p>
            so what is Mapbox GL doing in those first few seconds?  it's building vector tiles on the
            fly!  pretty much every web map works this way: you divide your data into tiles at
            different zoom levels.  at each zoom level, you split the previous level's tiles into
            four smaller tiles.  you can then show different amounts of detail at different zoom levels.

      <section>
        <h2>your data on vector tiles</h2>

        <aside class="notes">
          <p>
          note I said vector tiles.  in days of yore, you'd get your data out of database or
          wherever as a shapefile, then you'd pick a style, then you'd render that data down
          to raster image tiles, and you'd serve those pre-rendered tiles to the client.  if
          you wanted to change the style, you had to rebuild your tiles from scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            now, we still need to get the data - this time in GeoJSON format - but we can send
            that data down to the client, build vector tiles on the fly, then style them however
            we want!  this makes it much faster to iterate on web maps.

          so we've seen how we can render lots of data in a map.  we've also seen how we
          can present that data so our users can understand it.  finally, we've seen how
          we can move vector tile processing to the backend, so that we can handle even
          larger datasets.
