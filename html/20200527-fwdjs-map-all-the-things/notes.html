<h2>Slide 0</h2>
hi everyone!  welcome to Map All The Things with Mapbox GL.  i'm Evan Savage.
<h2>Slide 1</h2>
Code for Canada developer fellow working with City of Toronto on MOVE, which is a project
to bring decades of the City's collision and traffic volume data into a single platform.
<h2>Slide 2</h2>
<p>
  a lot of data governments (and people) care about is geospatial: you can and should
  put it on a map.  that's long been the case, as you can see from this 1915 map
  exploring how people get around Toronto.
</p>
<p>
  so geospatial data's nothing new.  what's new is the size of that data.
  on the MOVE project, for instance, we handle 1.5M collisions and 120M
  traffic volume readings.
</p>
<h2>Slide 3</h2>
<p>
  to put those numbers in context, here's a map of all schools and
  educational institutions in Toronto.
</p>
<p>
  everyone has seen a map like this.  it's slow to load.  impossible
  to tell what's going on.  navigation is awful.  only 1200 markers!
</p>
<h2>Slide 4</h2>
<p>
so that's what this talk is about: how do we handle this much data?
going to focus on three important questions.
</p>
<p>
  first: how can we render large datasets - what tools can we use that are performant enough?
  second: how can we understand large datasets - what can we do to help our users make sense of it all?
  third: how can we process large datasets - what can we do when the data is so large, that we need
  to do work upfront to even make these first two things possible?
</p>
<h2>Slide 5</h2>
let's start with rendering: showing the data, period.
<h2>Slide 6</h2>
to render data in MOVE, we use a library called Mapbox GL.
it's not the only mapping library out there: Leaflet and OpenLayers.
that said, it has a number of very useful features, as we'll see
throughout this presentation.
<h2>Slide 7</h2>
<p>
as with most complex graphics, maps are often built out of layers.  the bottom-most
layer is your basemap.  (switch back to previous slide to show)  so here, all these
outlines of continents, and borders, and names of things...that's our basemap.
</p>
<p>
  in web mapping, you need a container div to store your map in.  Mapbox GL is no different.
</p>
<p>
  we won't go over them here, but there's a lot of other options to control interactions
  and zoom / pan bounds and such.  once we have our options, can create a Mapbox GL Map
  object.
</p>
<h2>Slide 8</h2>
for this talk, I'll be focusing on data from Toronto.  just as with other
mapping libraries, you can set minimum and maximum zoom levels as well as a bounding
box for panning.  unlikely that you need all zoom levels.
<h2>Slide 9</h2>
<p>
next up: our dataset.  I'm using the collisions dataset from MOVE.  can't share this
quite yet, but we're in the process of publishing through Open Data.
</p>
<p>
  so we need some GeoJSON features.  I'm using the last 3 years, or about 150k
  collisions.  in Mapbox GL, each feature needs a unique numeric ID and a geometry.
  you can also add more properties.  here we're taking KSI, which stands for
  killed and seriously injured collisions - these can't be reduced to mere
  data points, but it is crucial to understand where, when, and why these are occurring
  so that we can reduce and, someday, eliminate the deadliest collisions from our
  roadways.
</p>
<p>
  we can then take those features and convert them to
  GeoJSON features using JSON functions in PostgreSQL.  then we can aggregate
  them all into a GeoJSON feature collection and dump that out.
</p>
<h2>Slide 10</h2>
we store this SQL query in a file download_collisions.sql and run it, storing
its output into a GeoJSON file.
<h2>Slide 11</h2>
we can then use the Fetch API available in modern browsers to load this
data into a JavaScript object.
<h2>Slide 12</h2>
<p>
  now the fun part.  we start with source: GeoJSON type, using our newly loaded
  collisions data.  we then create layer: give it an ID, tie it to the collisions
  source, and use type circle - we're going to draw circles for each data point.
</p>
<p>
  in Mapbox GL, you can style your layers.  here we're telling it how to draw
  these circles: what color, what outline, how big.
</p>
<h2>Slide 13</h2>
<p>
  takes a while to load: as we'll discuss in a bit, Mapbox GL is doing a lot of work up
  front to make sure we can navigate this smoothly once it loads.
</p>
<p>
  the result is pretty jarring, and in more ways than one.  first: that's 150k collisions
  over 3 years.  50k per year, 150 per day, 6 per hour.  even though most are minor, the
  human impact of this is staggering.  we can, and must, do better.
</p>

<p>
  this makes it especially shameful that this map doesn't do the dataset justice.
  for a City staff member trying to improve safety on our roads and pathways, this is
  more or less completely useless.  here, too, we can and must do better.
</p>

<p>
  about the only good thing here is that, using Mapbox GL GeoJSON sources and layers,
  we can navigate this dataset much more smoothly than our marker-based schools map
  even though there's a lot more data.
</p>
<h2>Slide 14</h2>
<p>
  so what is Mapbox GL doing in those first few seconds?  it's building vector tiles on the
  fly!  pretty much every web map works this way: you divide your data into tiles at
  different zoom levels.  at each zoom level, you split the previous level's tiles into
  four smaller tiles.  you can then show different amounts of detail at different zoom levels.
</p>
<h2>Slide 15</h2>
<p>
note I said vector tiles.  in days of yore, you'd get your data out of database or
wherever as a shapefile, then you'd pick a style, then you'd render that data down
to raster image tiles, and you'd serve those pre-rendered tiles to the client.  if
you wanted to change the style, you had to rebuild your tiles from scratch.
</p>
<p>
  now, we still need to get the data - this time in GeoJSON format - but we can send
  that data down to the client, build vector tiles on the fly, then style them however
  we want!  this makes it much faster to iterate on web maps.
</p>
<h2>Slide 16</h2>
so we can render data easily with Mapbox GL, and aside from a bit of loading time it
works with midsized datasets quite well.  we're still not helping users understand
this much data, though.  what can we do?  we'll explore three ways of dealing with
this:
<h2>Slide 17</h2>
clustering, where you group nearby points;
<h2>Slide 18</h2>
heatmaps, where you blur points together;
<h2>Slide 19</h2>
and visual differentiation, where you style various parts of your data
in different ways.
<h2>Slide 20</h2>
group nearby points.  reduces clutter, but loses location precision!
<h2>Slide 21</h2>
same GeoJSON source as before.  add cluster option.  we can change the cluster radius
to adjust the tradeoff between clutter and precision.
<h2>Slide 22</h2>
to display this, we now need 3 layers instead of 1.  the first two draw the clustered
circles with a label showing how many points are in the cluster.  the last one handles
points that are by themselves, not in a cluster.  we need two for the clusters because
of how Mapbox GL styles work: we need to style the circle and the text separately.
<h2>Slide 23</h2>
blur points together.  good for visualizing density, but doesn't work so
well with sparse data.
<h2>Slide 24</h2>
heatmaps work by blurring your points across a radius, then adding all those
blurred points up.  by adding enough peaks and sides of peaks together, we get
hotspots.  math aside, the key here for our purposes is that this can be done
efficiently using GL shaders.
<h2>Slide 25</h2>
<p>
  we can create a heatmap by using the heatmap layer type.
</p>
<p>
  we have a lot of things we can adjust here.  we can define a color ramp to blend
  seamlessly between heatmap intensity levels.  we can define a global intensity, which
  we increase as we zoom in to compensate for points spreading out.  same with that
  blur radius: we increase that too.
</p>
<p>
  allows for weighting of points: maybe some are more important than others (e.g. KSI)!
</p>
<h2>Slide 26</h2>
using Mapbox GL, we can set "zoom breakpoints" and blend layers together.
heatmap mainly useful zoomed out, clusters and points mainly useful closer in.
blend between them as the user zooms.
<h2>Slide 27</h2>
achieved by setting min and max zoom on different layers.  here we have the heatmap continue
1 zoom level past its breakpoint - we fade the heatmap out over that zoom level using opacity.
at the same time, we fade the clusters and points in to get a nice crossfade.
<h2>Slide 28</h2>
focus attention to more important points: bigger, brighter, visually distinct.
remember KSI: we want to draw attention to those, so we change the color, radius,
font, and other visual features.
<h2>Slide 29</h2>
first, we want to know if a cluster contains a KSI collision.  we use
cluster properties to aggregate these together - ksiAny is true if any
collision has the KSI flag set.
<h2>Slide 30</h2>
now we can use that aggregated property to style things.  here we want a bigger
radius when ksiAny is true.  we can also increase the radius with the number of
points in the cluster.  we can even multiply these two together to combine these
effects.
<h2>Slide 31</h2>
this is the power of vector tiles: you can quickly change the representation.
instead of hours or days to regenerate tiles, it's a quick code change and page
refresh, and you can see the result in seconds.  pre-attentive properties.
<h2>Slide 32</h2>
progressive disclosure: don't need to show everything at once.  different details
at different zoom levels.  show summary statistics visually, then allow users to
load full details via hover or click interactions.  all helps manage the visual
clutter.
<h2>Slide 33</h2>
on to the last question: processing.
<h2>Slide 34</h2>
<p>
  if you can load the whole dataset at once, GeoJSON layers actually work quite well!
</p>
<p>
  what if you can't, though?  loading 2.4 MB GeoJSON files is fine for a presentation,
  but I'm also only loading 3 years of data - we have data back to 1985, or 35 years ago.
  that would be roughly 20-30 MB, which is way too much for most web applications.
</p>
<h2>Slide 35</h2>
this is again part of the power of vector tiles: since we're only sending geometry,
not visual style, we can build vector tiles in the backend and continue to style them
in the frontend.  best of both worlds.
<h2>Slide 36</h2>
one tool for buliding vector tiles is tippecanoe, also maintained by Mapbox.
great for absolutely massive datasets!  lots of options for simplifying and
culling features to reduce tileset size.
<h2>Slide 37</h2>
tippecanoe produces an mbtiles file.  this is just a sqlite database that
maps (z, x, y), or (zoom, column, row), tile coordinates to tile data.
with tools like mbtiles-server, you can serve mbtiles files out of the box.
<h2>Slide 38</h2>
if you don't want to launch a separate server just for some map tiles, there's
mb-util.  this tool extracts individual tiles from the mbtiles archive, and
stores them all into a nested directory structure.  with your tiles as static
files, you can host them pretty much anywhere and behind pretty much anything.
<h2>Slide 39</h2>
with newer versions of PostgreSQL and PostGIS, you can even generate vector
tiles directly from the database.  this opens up even more possibilities for
prototyping and iterating on backend vector tile pipelines.
<h2>Slide 40</h2>
<p>
so we've seen how we can render lots of data in a map.  we've also seen how we
can present that data so our users can understand it.  finally, we've seen how
we can move vector tile processing to the backend, so that we can handle even
larger datasets.
</p>
<p>
  this is just the beginning; there's lots of other tools and techniques I didn't
  have time to cover.  hopefully this gives you a useful place to start, though.
</p>

thanks for listening, and happy mapping!
